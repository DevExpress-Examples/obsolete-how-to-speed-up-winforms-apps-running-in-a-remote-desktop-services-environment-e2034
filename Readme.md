# How to speed up WinForms apps, running in a Remote Desktop Services environment


<p>To achieve this goal, you can disable visual styles, skins, animations, and set various controls options. Note that here we additionally disable visual effects of two most "expensive" controls: RibbonControl and BarManager, which provide bars, docking functionality, context menus, alert windows and a Ribbon interface for your .NET WinForms applications. The attached example shows how to do this by an example of an XAF Windows Forms application. If you do not use XAF, then you can obtain the necessary code from this example, and put it in the entry point of your application (usually it's the Main method).</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong><br /> 1. You can greatly reduce memory consumption if you use the BarManager instead of RibbonControl on your forms. For example, an XAF Windows Forms application with BarManager consumes half as much memory than the same application using the RibbonControl. In XAF you can switch between the standard bars and ribbon menu using the FormStyle property of the Options node in the Model Editor.<br /> 2. To avoid painting problems when using the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument2642"><u>RibbonForm</u></a> and RibbonControl on Vista or Windows 7 with the Aero theme enabled, don't set the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.application.visualstylestate.aspx"><u>System.Windows.Forms.Application.VisualStyleState property</u></a> to VisualStyleState.NoneEnabled. Alternatively, you can set the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraBarsRibbonRibbonForm_AllowFormGlasstopic"><u>RibbonForm.AllowFormGlass</u></a> property to false. This is because we use the VisualStyleRenderer to draw text on transparent headers.</p>
